Hi, i made this readme to ensure that the project is able to be compiled without any errors, 
so it can be corrected, because i didn't do this project with VScode, and I am on linux, so
I am not completely sure whether running it from  VScode directly will work.

To be able to "play" the game there are the following options:

First option, I have already included the executable tetris_upf, so you can run it directly if you'd like.

Second option I have included a Makefile to compile all the project automatically by doing "make all" as well.

Third option you can compile manually with "cc *.c -o tetris"

Thank you very much
